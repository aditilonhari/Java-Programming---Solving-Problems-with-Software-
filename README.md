PROJECT TITLE: Java Programming - Solving Problems with Software!

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  Learn about basic control flow; object-oriented concepts including classes and methods; custom, open-source classes; and a design-implement-debug process that can be leveraged to build my knowledge of programming principles.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Multiple sub-projects implemented to learn and implement problem solving techniques in Java.
    a) findAllGenes - finds and prints a gene in a strand of DNA.
    b) findWebLinks - reads from a file at URL location and prints each URL on the page that is a link to youtube.com.

LEARNINGS FROM PROJECT: 
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;
2. Use conditionals and for loops appropriately in a Java program;
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs. 
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;
5. Develop a Java method to solve a specific problem;
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem; and
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses more than one method.
