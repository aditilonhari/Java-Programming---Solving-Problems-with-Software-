PROJECT TITLE: Java Programming - Solving Problems with Software!

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  Learn about basic control flow; object-oriented concepts including classes and methods; custom, open-source classes; and a design-implement-debug process that can be leveraged to build my knowledge of programming principles.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Multiple sub-projects implemented to learn and implement problem solving techniques in Java.  
    a) batchInversions - creating new images that are photographic negatives (or inverted images) of selected images.  
    b) findAllGenes - finds and prints a gene in a strand of DNA.  
    c) findWebLinks - reads from a file at URL location and prints each URL on the page that is a link to youtube.com.  
    d) grayScaleConvertor - processes images, and creates new images that are grayscale versions of each image.   

LEARNINGS FROM PROJECT:   
1. Edit, compile, and run a Java program;  
2. Use conditionals and for loops appropriately in a Java program;  
3. Use Java API documentation in writing programs.   
4. Debug a Java program using the scientific method;  
5. Develop a Java method to solve a specific problem;  
6. Develop a set of test cases as part of developing a program;  
7. Create a class with multiple methods that work together to solve a problem;  
8. Use divide-and-conquer design techniques for a program that uses more than one method.
